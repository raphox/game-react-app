The original project was using [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/) and Javascript. I changed to Vite + Typescript:

```
yarn create vite my-vue-app --template react-ts
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You can specify additional CLI options like `--port` or `--https`.

### `yarn build`

Build for production.

### `yarn preview`

Locally preview production build.
